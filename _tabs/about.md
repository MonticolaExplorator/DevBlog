Hi there! My name is Manuel Javier and I'm a software developer. I started this blog because I was curious how one would create a developer blog/portfolio. I had one spare Azure subscription and next thing you know I was wrapping my head around Jenkyll and spending half an hour writing this bio.

## Professional

I'm a software developer who is always willing to learn something new. I enjoy team work a lot. Argue with others in an amicable way is a great way to learn.

Mostly on the backend of things, I like having challenges and new things to do every day.

## Developing out of work

I did not use to be the kind of person that codes as a hobbie, so there was not much outside of work. But that is changing now, starting with this blog. I don't want it to be successful, I just want it to be. Moving on, there are a couple of things to do that I would like to cross down from my **list of things to do and keep doing**:

- Set up an ok looking blog, with bio and at least one real post
- Blog at least every couple of months
- Have fun with [numerai](https://numer.ai/) (yeah, I'm into that lately)
- Have fun with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (I sunk with the Titanic couple of years ago)
- Colaborate with open source projects
- Customize my blog theme
- Have a better bio here

## There is a crazy world out there

Having fun with computers and solving problems are not the only things that I enjoy. Seemingly, I sail a Snipe dinghy from time to time. I like reading and hikking, but I don't do it that often. I am a lot into plants, they are my favourite way to decorate a home because they are alive. They change, they adapt, they grow. They also die sometimes and you have to replace them with others. They also need your care, which again means you have to learn how to take care of them. By now I hope you know that I like learning things and doing things.

I like birdwatching a lot. Again, it is a diverse world with lots of things to learn and enjoy. Shapes, colours, sizes, behaviours, the way they fly, the way they sing... And it is a little bit like playing Pokemon when you spot an uncommon bird.
